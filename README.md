-   **Font**: Geist font family for modern typography

## Getting Started

Use Node.js 24 LTS (the dependency tree requires Node.js 22.13 or newer).

1. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
-   `npm run build` - Build production application
-   `npm run start` - Start production server
-   `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality
-   `npm test` - Verify the Next.js ESLint glob compatibility adapter

## Dependency Security

Run `npm audit` to check both production and development dependencies.
The scoped `@next/eslint-plugin-next` override replaces its `fast-glob`
dependency with a local adapter backed by `tinyglobby` 0.2.17 to remove the
unpatched `braces` stack-exhaustion vulnerability (GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm).
The adapter preserves the plugin's `globSync` directory behavior by disabling
automatic directory expansion, removing trailing directory slashes, and retaining
absolute input paths. Keep this
override scoped to the plugin; it is not a general fast-glob replacement.
Remove it when the upstream plugin no longer depends on vulnerable braces.
